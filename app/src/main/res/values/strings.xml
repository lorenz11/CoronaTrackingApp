    <string name="aboutvirus1">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
        requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease,
        diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes
        and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and
        not touching your face.
        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs
        or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
        At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials
        evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical
        findings become available. \n\n <i>Source: Website WHO</i></string>

    <string name="headline1"><b>How this App works</b></string>
    <string name="headline2"><b>Privacy</b></string>

    <string name="aboutapp1">This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy to transform your device into a beacon,
        that constantly sends out a signal encoded such that other devices with the same app installed
        can detect that another user is nearby. They will than attempt to connect to this device transmitting
        a timestamp and a checksum. This app will later download keys from a server and check if one of the
        saved timestamp checksum pairs matches one or several of those keys. That way this app will be able to tell if
        you have been close to infected persons.</string>

    <string name="aboutapp2">Because this app does not use GPS to actually locate your device, but uses
        Bluetooth Low Energy to detect proximity, it is not able to track its users. Not even the ID unique
        to your phones app (generated at first start) will be known to other users or the server except if you get
        infected and report that information. When another users phone detects proximity to you (your device) it will
        just receive an encrypted value with no similarity to your actual ID and saves that value locally. In conclusion you
        don\'t have to worry about being tracked by other users or the owner of the main server or giving
        away sensitive data.</string>
